# Aircraft Noise Prediction Model

This repository contains a **machine learning model** designed to predict **aircraft (airfoil) sound pressure** based on NASA’s Airfoil Self-Noise dataset. The goal is to **help engineers and researchers estimate noise levels quickly**, without the need for expensive and time-consuming physical experiments.

---

## Motivation

Measuring aircraft noise traditionally requires **large-scale experiments**, including:

- Large spaces  
- Manual calibration  
- Significant energy  
- Multiple personnel  

These experiments are **costly and time-intensive**. This project demonstrates how **machine learning** can provide **quick and meaningful predictions**, reducing time, effort, and costs while exploring the effect of different parameters on sound pressure.

## Dataset

The model uses the **NASA Airfoil Self-Noise dataset**, which is **noisy and complex**, providing a realistic scenario for learning how to handle real-world data.

## Model

The initial implementation uses **Linear Regression**, achieving an **R² of 0.45**. While this may seem low, it is reasonable given the **dataset’s noise and complexity**.  

Many implementations for this dataset use **deep learning**, but this project demonstrates that even **basic models** provide meaningful predictions and learning opportunities for beginners.
